# log2seq

log2seq is a python package to help parsing syslog-like messages into word sequences that is more suitable for further automated analysis.
It is based on a customizable procedure of rules in order, using regular expressions.

## Introduction

In log analysis, sometimes you may face following format of log messages:
	
	Jan  1 12:34:56 host-device1 system[12345]: host 2001:0db8:1234::1 (interface:eth0) disconnected

This message cannot well splitted with str.split or re.split, because the usage of `:` is not consistent.

log2seq processes this message in multiple steps (in default):

1. Process message header (i.e., timestamp and source hostname)
1. Split message body into word sequence by standard symbol strings (e.g., spaces and brackets)
1. Fix words that should not be splitted later (e.g., ipv6 addr)
1. Split words by inconsistent symbol strings (e.g., `:`)

Following is a sample code:

	mes = "Jan  1 12:34:56 host-device1 system[12345]: host 2001:0db8:1234::1 (interface:eth0) disconnected"

	import log2seq
	parser = log2seq.init_parser()

	d = parser.process_line(mes)
	print(d["words"])

It outputs following sequence.

	['system', '12345', 'host', '2001:0db8:1234::1', 'interface', 'eth0', 'disconnected']

You can see `:` in ipv6 addr is left, and other `:` are ignored.
